Image Classification Using CNN and Keras
This code pattern demonstrates how images, specifically document images like id cards, application forms, cheque leaf, can be classified using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Even though there are code patterns for image classification, none of them showcase how to use CNN to classify images using Keras libraries.

Many organisations process application forms, such as loan applications, from it's customers. Along with the application forms, customers provide supporting documents needed for processing applications. Some of these supporting documents could be identity proof document, address proof document. Generally application forms, along with supporting documents, are scanned and captured into the organisation's systems for further processing of applications. When the system is fed with a set of all these scanned documents, it needs to identify the form document so that it can process it further. This code pattern shows how to classify images and identify application form document among them.

What is CNN and why CNN?
A CNN is a supervised learning technique which needs both input data and target output data to be supplied. These are classified by using their labels in order to provide a learned model for future data analysis.

Typically a CNN has three main constituents - a Convolutional Layer, a Pooling Layer and a Fully connected Dense Network. The Convolutional layer takes the input image and applies m number of nxn filters to receive a feature map. The feature map is next fed into the max pool layer which is essentially used for dimensionality reduction, it picks only the best features from the feature map. Finally, all the features are flattened and sent as input to the fully connected dense neural network which learns the weights using backpropagation and provides the classification output.

The motivation behind the CNN is that it is based on the way the visual cortex functions, where one object in the scene is in focus while the rest is blurred, similarly the CNN takes one section/window of the input image at a time for classification. Each time the CNN will produce a feature map for each section, in the convolutional layer. In the Pooling layer it removes the excess features and takes only the most important features for that section, thereby performing feature extraction. Hence, with the use of CNNs we don't have to perform an additional feature extraction technique.

CNNs require lesser pre-processing as compared to other similar classification algorithms. While traditional MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron) algorithms have significant accuracy for image recognition, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality due to the nodes being fully connected, and hence cannot be scaled to high resolution images. CNNs overcome these challenges posed by MLP by exploiting the spatial correlation of an image. This is done by enforcing a pattern of local connectivity between adjacent neuron layers. Hence, CNNs prove to be superior at Image classification, Video Analysis, Natural Language Processing and wide range of other applications as compared to other techniques.

This code pattern covers the following aspects:

Dataset preparation for training and testing
Running notebook for image classification
In this code pattern, we have considered applications for Purchase Agreement and Rental Agreement. Typical documents that are submitted for these applications are PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, Driving License, Cheque leaf, Passport and the application form itself. This code pattern identifies the application form document from all the other types of documents.

We will use Python, Jupyter notebook, CNN in Keras libraries and IBM Cloud Object Storage
